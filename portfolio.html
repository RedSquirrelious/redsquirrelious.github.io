                            Am pretty sure this was our first group project. It was fun to do, but it was also challenging. We were all so shy and polite that we didn't push each other as far as we could have. No one wanted to intrude on anyone else's evening. It showed during our project demonstration. The other groups didn't seem to have that problem, which also showed. Alas. A great reminder on setting expectations.

                            Our first pair project. It was challenging to get into the groove, but once we were there, we had fun and built this game. I particularly liked the apple-counter.
