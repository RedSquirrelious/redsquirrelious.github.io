                        <p>
                            I tried to bake miniature pumpkin pies (tartlets, really) for Thanksgiving. Surprisingly, it worked out. The tartlets were delicious.

                        <p> After resuming bicycling after a long hiatus, I was working on building endurance. The first photo shows me after I made it from downtown Seattle to Discovery Park. The other photo shows a pannier rack that I installed. Both accomplishments made me feel somewhat smug.

                        <h2> Kayaking </h2>
                        <p> I took a kayaking class in 2015. As part of the class, we had to flip our kayaks over and demonstrate that we could haul ourselves back into the boat. I did it successfully, hence the wet hair and smug grin in the first photo. Later, I went out kayaking with my step-dog, who is a kayaking pro (as can be seen from her chill attitude in the second photo).
